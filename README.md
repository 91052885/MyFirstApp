### Create a simple app that includes four textViews, four imageViews and two buttons and uses LinearLayout.  The buttons should produce output to both the Android logcat and an Android Toast.  Add an aesthetic, that is, give it some style beyond the default bland grey.  Have a theme for what your buttons do and what the elements look like.  Choose a color scheme and change the font.  You want to make the client happy, so make your product appealing.
#### This app is just me trying to satisfy my fascination with randomness and colors.
